<h1>I attempted to redesign the UNA Portal login and User Experience while in the app.</h1>
<h2>I felt like the login page above was too cluttered and had too much for a login. I attempted a more minimal login design.</h2>

<h2>I also believed that the user experience of the actual portal interface had too much at the forefront and could be made more minimal and easier to see/use.
  With the basic user profile at the top and then the collapsible sections with clear names and links to the other facets of Portal underneath.</h2>
